    <h3>Who is Brightparagon?</h3>
    <pre>
      I'm a junior web developer based on Seoul who loves Web technologies(of course!), Philosophy, Arts, <br>
      Music, Foreign languages, Physics, Travel. There are lots of things to talk about it! <br>
      <strong>Nowadays?</strong><br>
      I'm still developing(improving) this web app and running two team projects in Seoul which focus on <br>
      learning React.js, Redux, Webpack, ElasticSearch and develop services using those. <br>
      You can check this here: <strong><a href="https://github.com/brightparagon/mern">MERN Project</a></strong><br>
      Also, you can contact me with my email: kyeongmo2@gmail.com and see about me on <strong><a href="https://github.com/brightparagon">GitHub</a></strong>

    <h3>Why made this blog application?</h3>
    <pre>
      This is my frist web application with Javascript-alone which I didn't know any about before. <br>
      I used to develop with Java, JSP, Spring. And I started to be interested in building web application <br>
      using only Javascript with related frameworks like Angular.js, Node.js and so on. <br>
      That's why I made it! It doesn't serve as a good Blog Service now, but I will keep adding and upgrading <br>
      good features continuously. <br>
      There's no special reason to choose blog to make. At least I needed my blog! Isn't it cool to build my own?
